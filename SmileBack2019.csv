Came back, and it's not acted up once.  I knew Clayton must have arrived, as like a car, the monitors ceased to act up. Been 2.5 hrs. and nothing!  I will be monitoring this situation and hope it's all good to go. Clayton tried a couple items just to be on the safe side. Fingers crossed the ghost is gone. cheers, Beverly",,,1

"This one time Nichol was out having lunch at a combination cajun-greek burger place when Sylvester Stallone walks in and starts pouring drinks all over the bar.  Nichol was having none of it, so she immediately grabbed his wrists and smashed his own fists into his face. They whole time she was yelling ""STOP HITTING YOURSELF! STOP HITTING YOURSELF!"" and he was all ""EEEUUUYYRGGH! OOWW! AWWW!"" and it was the most intense display of macho-ism and domination I've seen in a cajun-greek based setting.",,,1

This is the second issue that solut has assisted me with where proper planning including the client would have gone a long way.  In this case, I was eating my lunch when Corina called to assist with the boardroom computer, had I known when she was going to call I'd likely not have prepped my lunch.  In the previous example, the issue took multiple days to remedy as the solut resource and I kept missing each other's calls.",,,0
